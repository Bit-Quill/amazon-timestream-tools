# Amazon sample InfluxDB client applications

## Getting started

Below is a list of sample applications to use with the InfluxDB Timestream Connector. The sample applications are implementations of the [InfluxDB client libraries](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/tools/api_client_libraries/) that ingest a sample line protocol dataset and use SigV4 authentication for each request. Each sample is fully functional and can ingest data to Timestream for LiveAnalytics with the InfluxDB Timestream Connector running locally, or deployed as a Lambda function with a REST API Gateway.
